🛠 Ultra-Detailed Replit AI Prompt: Restore MyGenetics Front Page Design and Functionality

Hi Replit — I need your help restoring the exact look, structure, and behavior of my fitness app homepage. The current version is halfway there, but multiple parts of the layout, alignment, and design are still broken or degraded.

I have screenshots and a full video showing how it originally looked, and this prompt includes pixel-accurate instructions to match it perfectly.

✅ PAGE SECTIONS TO REBUILD (In Order from Top to Bottom)

1. 🔺 Top Navigation Bar
Logo: MyGenetics (bold red) with “ALPHA” in blue below it
Navigation Button: Home (top right, red hover state)
Background color: dark navy (#0C0C1F or similar)
Height: fixed, slim padding
2. 🧬 Hero Section: Main Call to Action
Headline: DISCOVER YOUR GENETIC POTENTIAL
“GENETIC POTENTIAL” should be styled with a bold pink–orange gradient (left to right)
Font: all-caps, large, modern sans-serif (e.g., Poppins or Inter)
Subheadline: “Optimize your fitness routine based on your unique body structure…”
Centered, max-width ~60%
Text color: white, font-size: ~18px
Spacing: Enough vertical padding to make it feel like a clean hero area
Background: Solid black or very dark gray (#0F0F0F)
3. 💡 Information Block: “Why Body Analysis Matters”
Left column with heading: Why Body Analysis Matters
Subtext: “Your body’s structure significantly affects how you should train…”
Bullet-style sections (icon + title + subtitle), each with:
Icon (e.g. dumbbell, bone, etc.)
Section titles:
Muscle Insertions
Limb Proportions
Bone Structure
Each with 1–2 line descriptions
Icons: circular button-style, lightly colored (e.g., blue/purple)
Text: white, font-size: 14–16px
Spacing: Add right margin to this section so it doesn’t clash with the form

💻 TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS

Ensure / renders correctly with or without session variables
Use {% if %} conditionals around analysis data to avoid template errors
JS/Chart rendering should be disabled on the homepage — only enable on results
Separate layout blocks into base.html for reuse (navbar + footer)
🧠 FILES TO DOUBLE CHECK
templates/index.html (main homepage template)
static/style.css (if present, link it in base.html)
base.html (layout inheritance structure)
Icons should use Font Awesome or SVGs if possible
✅ FINAL GOAL:

Rebuild the full front page with:

Modern fitness-brand visuals
Balanced layout between info and form
Crisp visual hierarchy
Flawless responsiveness across screen sizes
Please walk through each section and restore based on this prompt. Let me know which files you change.
