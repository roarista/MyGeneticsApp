🧠 Replit Prompt: Enable Full Workout Personalization Based on Dynamic Muscle Scores
Please update the current workout generation logic to do the following:
🔍 1. Read Dynamic Muscle Group Status

Ensure that the user’s muscle development scores from the Body Analysis (e.g., “Arm: Needs Growth”, “Shoulders: Well Developed”) are:
Pulled dynamically per user (not hardcoded defaults)
Mapped to three categories:
"Needs Growth" → underdeveloped
"Average" → normal development
"Well Developed" → already strong
Each user should have different combinations of strengths and weaknesses, and these must be read in real-time and shown correctly.
🧱 2. Fix Muscle Category Display

In the “Muscle Development” box:
Right now, all muscles show as Average, even when real data varies.
Fix this by dynamically showing each group in the correct section:
Needs Growth:
- Shoulders
- Core

Average:
- Chest
- Arms

Well Developed:
- Back
- Legs
Use the user’s real measurements and development scores to assign these categories accurately.
🏋️ 3. Generate Full PPL Routine Based on These Scores

Use a consistent Push / Pull / Legs structure:
Push Day: Chest, Shoulders, Triceps
Pull Day: Back, Biceps
Leg Day: Quads, Glutes, Hamstrings, Calves
Each day should include 4 to 7 exercises total based on these rules:
Muscle Group Development	# Exercises	Sets	Reps
Needs Growth	2–3	4–5	10–15
Average	1–2	3	10–12
Well Developed	0–1	2	8–10
🔁 Apply this logic within each day's muscle targets.
For example:
On Push Day, if the user needs more shoulder growth:
Give 3 shoulder exercises
Give 2 chest and 1 triceps exercise
On Pull Day, if back is well developed and biceps are weak:
Give 1 back exercise and 3 bicep-focused ones
📦 4. Optional: Use or Expand This Exercise Pool

If needed, build or expand this pool:
{
  "Push": {
    "Chest": ["Bench Press", "Incline DB Press", "Push-Up", "Cable Crossover"],
    "Shoulders": ["Overhead Press", "Lateral Raise", "Arnold Press"],
    "Triceps": ["Skullcrusher", "Dips", "Triceps Pushdown"]
  },
  "Pull": {
    "Back": ["Pull-Up", "Barbell Row", "Seated Cable Row", "Lat Pulldown"],
    "Biceps": ["Bicep Curl", "Incline Curl", "Hammer Curl"]
  },
  "Legs": {
    "Quads": ["Squat", "Leg Press", "Lunges"],
    "Hamstrings": ["Romanian Deadlift", "Lying Curl"],
    "Glutes": ["Hip Thrust", "Glute Kickbacks"],
    "Calves": ["Seated Calf Raise", "Standing Calf Raise"]
  }
}
✅ Summary of What to Fix:

 Read actual user muscle data and display it accurately (Needs Growth / Average / Well Developed)
 Dynamically generate 4–7 exercises per workout based on weaknesses
 Use Push / Pull / Legs framework, with volume adjusted per muscle score
 Make sure volume logic follows the table above
 Each user should have a different routine based on their specific physique
Let me know if you need sample data to test with.
