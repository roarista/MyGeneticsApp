🧠 Prompt: Fix Personalized Push/Pull/Legs Workout Generator Based on Muscle Development
Please update the workout generator logic so that it uses real user data from the Muscle Development Analysis and correctly structures the weekly routine using a Push / Pull / Legs split with accurate exercise targeting and adaptive volume.
✅ Required Fixes and Specifications:
🔁 1. Muscle Group Analysis Logic

Currently, all users are shown as "Average" across all muscle groups regardless of actual data.
Fix: Use the actual measurements to classify each muscle group as:
Well Developed (green)
Average (yellow)
Needs Growth (red)
Make sure this analysis updates correctly when a new user uploads their photos.
🧠 2. Smart Volume Targeting Based on Needs

Goal: More training volume (not excessive) should be directed to weaker muscle groups.
For example:
If Shoulders = Needs Growth, then on Push day → include 2–3 shoulder-focused exercises
If Back = Well Developed, Pull day = 1 back exercise only
Volume adjustments can be:
More exercises (up to 3 per underdeveloped muscle group)
Slightly more sets/reps (e.g., 4 sets x 12–15 reps for weaker groups)
🗓️ 3. Weekly Workout Structure (PPL)

Update logic to assign the following split, rotating over 6 days:
Mon: Push (Chest, Shoulders, Triceps)
Tue: Pull (Back, Biceps, Rear Delts)
Wed: Legs (Quads, Glutes, Hamstrings, Calves)
Thu: Push
Fri: Pull
Sat: Legs
Sun: Rest
Make sure each day contains 5–8 exercises total (never over 8).
Days should never be empty or overloaded with just 1–2 exercises.
🏋️ 4. Exercise Generator by Muscle Group

Pull from a database/list of categorized exercises.
Randomize slightly for variety, but prioritize underdeveloped areas.
Examples:
Push Day:
Chest: Incline DB Press, Push-ups
Shoulders: Overhead Press, Lateral Raise
Triceps: Triceps Dips, Skullcrushers
Pull Day:
Back: Pull-ups, Barbell Row
Biceps: Curl variations
Rear Delts: Reverse Pec Deck, Face Pulls
Legs:
Quads: Lunges, Leg Press
Hamstrings: Romanian Deadlifts
Glutes: Hip Thrusts
Calves: Standing Calf Raise
🧮 5. Volume/Rest Guidelines

Keep sets/reps within these guidelines:
Weak groups: 3–4 sets, 10–15 reps
Average groups: 3 sets, 10–12 reps
Well developed groups: 2–3 sets, 8–10 reps
Rest time: 45–90 seconds per set
🧪 Testing Instructions
Test with multiple users who have different development scores (e.g., weak shoulders, strong chest).
Make sure Push/Pull/Legs logic adapts properly and reflects the correct muscles.
Ensure no workout day is blank or imbalanced.
