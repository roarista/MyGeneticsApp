Looking at the images and the code, I can identify several issues with the results page:

1. **Missing Styling**: The page appears to be unstyled HTML, missing the Tailwind CSS classes that should make it look modern and consistent with the first page.

2. **Layout Issues**: The content is displaying in a basic vertical stack without proper spacing, sections, or visual hierarchy.

3. **Missing Visual Elements**: The page should show:
   - A clean layout with proper sections
   - Well-formatted measurements and analysis results
   - Professional typography
   - Proper spacing and padding
   - Cards or containers for different sections
   - Navigation elements

Let me check the template file that's being used for this page.

Read file: templates/tailwind_results.html
I can see the issue now. The template file has all the proper Tailwind CSS styling, but it seems the styles are not being loaded correctly. This is happening because:

1. The CSS file is not being found - the template tries to load it from `static/css/tailwind_styles.css`
2. The template expects certain variables that might not be passed correctly from the backend

Here's what needs to be fixed:

1. First, let's check if the static folder and CSS file exist:

Good, we have a css directory. Let's check its contents:

I see that we don't have a `tailwind_styles.css` file, but we do have several CSS files including `fitness-tailwind.css`. Let's check the template file to see how it's trying to load the CSS:

Search files...
I can see that the issue is in the `tailwind_results.html` template, which is trying to load a non-existent `tailwind_styles.css` file:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ url_for('static', filename='css/tailwind_styles.css') }}">
```

However, we have a `fitness-tailwind.css` file in the `static/css` directory that appears to contain the Tailwind-inspired styles. Let me fix this by updating the template to use the correct CSS file:

```html:templates/tailwind_results.html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>MyGenetics - Analysis Results</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ url_for('static', filename='css/fitness-tailwind.css') }}">
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/alpinejs@2.8.2/dist/alpine.min.js" defer></script>
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/chart.js"></script>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/aos@next/dist/aos.js"></script>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/aos@next/dist/aos.css" />
// ... existing code ...
```
I've updated the template to use the correct CSS file name `fitness-tailwind.css` instead of `tailwind_styles.css`. This should resolve the issue of the missing CSS file. The styles from `fitness-tailwind.css` should now be properly loaded when viewing the results page.

Let me know if you'd like me to check anything else or if you need any other adjustments to the styling setup!
