### ✅ For Replit’s AI:


```
Hi Replit, I need you to implement and fix a key feature in my fitness app — the personalized workout planner.


---


🛠️ **Current Issue**
- The “Select Your Workout” buttons (Monday to Sunday) don’t display any workouts when clicked.
- The workouts are not personalized based on the user’s body analysis.


---


🎯 **Goal**
Create a system where:
1. When a user clicks a day (e.g., Tuesday), a personalized workout plan for that day appears.
2. Each workout is tailored based on the user’s genetic/body scan analysis (weak points, strong points, etc.).
3. The workout respects the split (e.g., Tuesday = Pull), but emphasizes underdeveloped muscle groups and maintains strong ones.


---


📊 **Inputs Available**
- Body scan data: muscle measurements, growth potential, muscle group strength level (low, medium, high), etc.
- Current training split: Push (Mon/Fri), Pull (Tues/Sat), Legs (Weds/Sun), Recovery (Thurs)
- Experience level: Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced


---


🔧 **Instructions**
1. **Create a mapping system** that evaluates the user's physique data and assigns each muscle group a status:
   - Underdeveloped → High priority in training
   - Average → Standard volume
   - Strong → Maintenance volume


2. **For each day’s split**, create a `generateWorkout(day, userData)` function that:
   - Receives the selected day (e.g., “Tuesday”) and the user’s data
   - Outputs a list of exercises for relevant muscle groups
   - Prioritizes weak areas (e.g., if biceps are small → extra curls on Pull day)
   - Balances strong areas with less volume


3. **Build a UI interaction system**:
   - Add dynamic state handling so when a user clicks a day (like "Tuesday"), the page updates with that day’s workout.
   - Display the workout under “Select Your Workout” or in a modal/card component.
   - Each workout should include:
     - Exercise name
     - Sets & reps
     - Target muscle
     - Rest time


4. **Add fallback/default logic** for users with incomplete scan data.


---


💡 **Example: Tuesday Pull Routine for a user with weak biceps**
```
Tuesday - Pull Day
- Deadlifts: 4x6
- Pull-Ups: 3x8
- Barbell Rows: 3x10
- Bicep Curls (priority): 4x12
- Hammer Curls: 3x15
```


---


📌 **Final Requirements**
- Workouts must change per user depending on physique data
- Day buttons must function and show different content
- Code must be modular for future edits (e.g., adding cardio recommendations or auto periodization)
