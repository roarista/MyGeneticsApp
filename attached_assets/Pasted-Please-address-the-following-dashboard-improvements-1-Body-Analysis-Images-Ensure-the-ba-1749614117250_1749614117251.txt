Please address the following dashboard improvements:

**1. Body Analysis Images:**  
- Ensure the backend passes both front and back body image URLs (with overlays, if possible) as `front_image_url` and `back_image_url` to the template.
- In the template, stack these vertically (one above the other), using classes like `w-auto h-96 mx-auto mb-4 rounded-lg shadow`.
- If images are missing, show a clear “No image uploaded” message, not just an icon.

**2. Spread Out Charts & Fill Empty Spaces:**  
- Rearrange the grid so that graphs and key metrics are distributed throughout the dashboard, not just at the bottom.
- Use a responsive grid (`grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-4`) for all cards (images, metrics, graphs, summaries).
- If there would otherwise be empty space, move relevant charts or insights up, so the dashboard is visually balanced and there are no large blank areas.

**3. No Large Empty Spaces:**  
- Make sure every section of the dashboard has meaningful content (graph, image, or summary).
- Adjust Tailwind grid/flex as needed to ensure no column/row is left mostly blank.

**4. Strengths and Weaknesses Analysis:**  
- In the backend, for each major muscle group (chest, back, shoulders, arms, legs, core), generate a category: `well_developed`, `average`, or `needs_growth` (based on score thresholds).
- Pass this info to the template as a dictionary or list.
- In the UI, add a card “Muscle Strengths & Weaknesses” (or similar) that displays each muscle with a color-coded badge:
    - Green = Well Developed
    - Yellow = Average
    - Red = Needs Growth
- Add a short summary: “Your strengths are: … Your areas to focus: …” based on which categories the user falls into.

**General:**  
- Use only Tailwind, not Bootstrap.
- Make the overall visual flow professional and actionable.
- Explain what you changed and why.

After you’re done, every column and row should be full, images should show (vertically), and users should see their strengths and weaknesses called out in a clear, visual way.
