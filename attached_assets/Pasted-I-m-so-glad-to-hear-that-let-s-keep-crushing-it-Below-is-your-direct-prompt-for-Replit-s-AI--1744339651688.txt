### ⚙️ Replit Prompt: Fix Left Panel Metrics Not Displaying

---

Hi Replit! I need your help fixing a **UI data sync issue** in my fitness app.

---

### 🧩 PROBLEM:

After users upload front/back photos and input height/weight, the **analysis results are calculated properly** and shown **on the right panel**. This includes:

- Body Fat %  
- BMI  
- Lean Body Mass  
- FFMI  
- Muscle Building Potential  
- Body Type  

But on the **left panel** — under **“Body Composition”** — the same metrics either show as:

- `N/A`  
- `Unknown`  
- or are completely **missing**  

So the two sides of the results page are **not synchronized**, even though the calculations are being done successfully.

---

### 🛠️ OBJECTIVE:

Make the **left panel** display the same data values shown on the **right** — so that all key metrics are **consistently visible** in both places.

---

### ✅ TASKS FOR YOU:

1. **Locate where the right-panel data is calculated.**  
   - Identify the backend logic or API call that computes values like `body_fat_percentage`, `bmi`, `ffmi`, and `lean_body_mass`.

2. **Check how the left panel is being rendered.**  
   - Is it referencing different variables?  
   - Is it being passed outdated or incomplete data in the `render_template()` call (or via props if frontend is JS-based)?

3. **Inject the same values into the left panel.**  
   - Ensure the `body_fat`, `body_type`, and `muscle_building_potential` are passed from backend to frontend **and displayed in the left card**.

4. **Add conditional formatting if needed.**  
   - For example, if confidence is low or values are missing, you can:
     - Show a tooltip or warning icon  
     - Add a placeholder text like: "Calculated, confidence low"  

5. **(Optional)** Add a brief animation or smooth load effect when results populate both sides.

---

### 🧠 CONTEXT:

- All metrics are calculated and displayed correctly on the **right** side already.
- I just need to mirror them to the **left panel**.

Thanks Replit! Help me make this look smooth and synced 🔥

Let me know if you want a follow-up version that includes a **data structure refactor** to ensure both sides pull from the exact same centralized state (which can prevent this in future updates).
