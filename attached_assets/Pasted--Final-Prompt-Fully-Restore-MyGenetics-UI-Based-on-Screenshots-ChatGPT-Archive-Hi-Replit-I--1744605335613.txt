✅ Final Prompt: Fully Restore MyGenetics UI (Based on Screenshots + ChatGPT Archive)

Hi Replit — I need you to restore the MyGenetics app design and UI to perfectly match the version shown in the screenshots at this link:
🔗 Google Drive – MyGenetics UI screenshots

This is a fitness analysis app that uses image uploads + personal data to analyze physique and show body composition results. The entire layout, branding, and visual polish were broken recently, and I'm working to recover the original premium design.

🎯 GOAL

Rebuild the homepage and results page to match the original design exactly. That includes:

Fonts and font weights
Color themes (dark mode + vivid accent colors)
Spacing and padding
Icon style and positioning
Gradient styles
Form layout
Button shape and hover behavior
Footer structure
Responsive behavior
🧬 HOMEPAGE LAYOUT ( / route or index.html )

🔧 TECHNICAL BEHAVIOR

Use {% if analysis_results %} to prevent template errors
Destroy any existing charts before rendering new ones
Session values should update on each analysis, not persist old values
Validate all inputs on both client and server side
✅ Please walk through each section and match what’s shown in the screenshots.
Let me know what files you change so I can version-control this properly.

Once done, I’ll finalize the results page and the rest of the visual polish.

Thanks!
