**Prompt for Replit AI:**

Hi Replit 👋 I recently redesigned my app’s UI using **Lovable** to improve visual design and user experience. The preview of the new UI is here:  
🔗 **https://preview--physique-genesis-studio.lovable.app**

I'd like you to help me **replace the current UI** with this new one, while keeping all the **backend logic and analysis features** intact.

### ✅ Here’s what I need:

---

### 🧠 General Instructions

- **Rebuild the frontend using the new Lovable design.**
- You can either replicate the design manually or, if Lovable provides exportable HTML/CSS/JS, use that as a starting point.
- Please **implement this in the existing Replit codebase** using the appropriate frontend framework (e.g., React, HTML + CSS, etc.).

---

### 🎯 UI Integration Tasks

1. **Recreate layout and styling from Lovable**:
   - Use the new layout grid, cards, fonts, and color styles.
   - Keep it modern, bold, and fitness-themed.

2. **Replace the old interface with the new UI components**:
   - Profile analysis panel  
   - Dual image upload section  
   - Tabs for body composition, measurements, aesthetic scores  
   - Improved measurement output visualization (clean spacing, icons, indicators)

3. **Wire new UI elements to current app logic**:
   - Connect photo upload to the same endpoint or image-processing function.  
   - Ensure measurements (e.g., arm circumference, BMI, muscle potential) still pull from backend logic.  
   - Display real results using the updated styling (e.g., colors, confidence indicators).  

4. **Ensure full responsiveness and clean visual flow**:
   - Desktop, tablet, mobile layout support  
   - Use TailwindCSS or SCSS for styling if that’s what the app is using now  
   - Keep contrast readable and interactive elements clear

### 🧩 Technical Notes

- Backend logic and image analysis code **must stay unchanged**.
- Just plug the **new design** into the current backend endpoints.
- If you update file names or structure, please explain that in a comment.

### 📝 After Implementation

Please leave a comment explaining:
- What files were changed or added  
- How the Lovable design was broken into components  
- How the new frontend interacts with existing backend logic

Thanks so much! This new design will make the app feel far more professional and exciting 💪🔥
