I want the app to be able to obtain these measures of a person: Here are 20 of the most important physique metrics for achieving an aesthetic, bodybuilding‑style look. These focus on proportions, muscular development, and conditioning:

1. **Shoulder‑to‑Waist Ratio (V‑Taper)** 
   Measures shoulder width divided by waist circumference—key for that “X‑frame” look citeturn1search11 
 2. **Chest Circumference** 
   Depth and fullness of the pectorals, measured around the nipple line citeturn0search1 
 3. **Waist Circumference** 
   Taken at the narrowest point; a small waist accentuates upper‑body width citeturn0search1 
 4. **Hip Circumference** 
   Measurement at the widest part of the glutes; balances the V‑taper citeturn0search0 
 5. **Biceps Circumference** 
   Peak girth of the flexed biceps—higher “peak” often equates to more dramatic arms citeturn0search0 
 6. **Forearm Circumference** 
   Indicates lower‑arm development and grip strength potential citeturn0search0 
 7. **Wrist Circumference** 
   A proxy for bone structure; smaller wrists make muscles appear larger citeturn0search0 
 8. **Thigh (Quadriceps) Circumference** 
   Taken at the fullest point of the upper leg; critical for leg‑to‑torso balance citeturn0search1 
 9. **Calf Circumference** 
   Fullness and shape of the gastrocnemius; essential for completing the “X‑frame” citeturn0search1 
 10. **Neck Circumference** 
    Thickness of the neck muscles; contributes to overall upper‑body mass citeturn0search1 
 11. **Vascularity** 
    Visibility of veins—reflects low subcutaneous fat and muscle “pump” citeturn0search10 
 12. **Visible Abdominal Definition** 
    Clarity of the rectus abdominis and obliques—hallmark of conditioning citeturn1search11 
 13. **Deltoid Roundness (Shoulder Cap)** 
    3D fullness of the deltoid heads for that capped‑shoulder look citeturn1search11 
 14. **Lat Spread Width & Insertion Height** 
    How far the lats flare and where they attach—key for width and taper citeturn1search4 
 15. **Bicep Peak Height** 
    Vertical height of the biceps when flexed—defines arm aesthetics citeturn1search11 
 16. **Triceps Horseshoe Definition** 
    The U‑shaped outline of the triceps head—important for arm balance citeturn1search11 
 17. **Muscle Striations** 
    Fine, deep lines in the muscle fibers indicating extreme leanness citeturn0search10 
 18. **Symmetry & Balance** 
    Left‑vs‑right size comparisons across all major muscle groups citeturn1search11 
 19. **Overall Body Fat Percentage** 
    The single best indicator of conditioning and muscle definition citeturn0search10 
 20. **Waist‑to‑Hip Ratio (WHR)** 
    Ratio of waist circumference to hip circumference—used as a classic aesthetic measure citeturn1search3 

 Tracking and improving these metrics will help bodybuilders and enthusiasts sculpt the classic, balanced, and highly conditioned physique prized in aesthetic competitions and photo shoots. Here are **10 additional key metrics**—beyond the 20 we covered earlier—that significantly contribute to an aesthetic, well‑developed physique:

21. **Adonis Index (Golden Ratio)** – The shoulder‑to‑waist circumference ratio, ideally **1 : 1.618**, framing the classic “V”‑taper citeturn2search0 
 22. **Waist‑to‑Height Ratio** – Waist circumference divided by height; an ideal value is **≤ 0.45**, ensuring a slim midsection relative to stature citeturn2search0 
 23. **Grecian Ideal Proportions** – Body‑part circumferences scaled off waist size: shoulders 1.618×, chest 1.4×, biceps 0.5×, forearms 0.8×, neck same as biceps, thighs 0.75×, hips 1.25× waist citeturn0search0turn1search1 
 24. **Oblique Definition** – Visibility and separation of the external/internal obliques, sharpening the waistline and core aesthetics citeturn3search2 
 25. **Serratus Anterior Visibility** – Striated, “fan‑like” muscle along the ribcage beneath the chest, adding detailed mid‑torso definition citeturn4search5 
 26. **Rear Deltoid Development** – Fullness and roundness of the posterior deltoid head, crucial for balanced, 3‑D shoulder caps citeturn1search4 
 27. **Trapezius Thickness** – Thickness and slope of the upper traps, providing a smooth neck‑to‑shoulder transition citeturn1search4 
 28. **Erector Spinae (Lower Back) Definition** – Visibility and fullness of the spinal erectors, enhancing back aesthetics and posture citeturn5search7 
 29. **Hamstring Peak** – Side‑view curvature and separation of the hamstrings, balancing quad development for leg symmetry citeturn1search1 
 30. **Glute Shape & Fullness** – Roundness and projection of the gluteus maximus, key for lower‑body balance and overall silhouette citeturn1search1 

 Tracking and optimizing these alongside the core 20 metrics will give bodybuilders and enthusiasts a **comprehensive, data‑driven roadmap** to sculpting a truly aesthetic physique. I want the app to analyze one frontal body picture and one of the user's back body parts, that way, some measurements are more accurate and other measurements can be analysed. I want you to update the current code, writing the instructions and code of how to make it so I can copy it nto replit, in order for the app to require two pictures (one from the front of a person's body and one from the back), and using these pictures obtain the metrics mentioned above.
