🔧 Fix the Body Composition Estimation Chart – Dynamic User-Specific Calculations Required
The current chart displays static values (e.g., Body Fat %: 31.9, Lean Mass %: 68.1) across all users, which is incorrect. It must instead compute unique values per user based on uploaded photos and input data.
Please do the following:
✅ 1. Make Body Composition Dynamic and Personalized
Replace any static or hardcoded values. The body fat % and lean mass % must be dynamically calculated using:
a. User Input Data (already collected):

Height (in cm)
Weight (in kg)
Sex (male/female)
Age (in years)
b. Image Analysis Data (from uploaded body images):

Estimate waist circumference from the front-view photo using shoulder/waist pixel ratios
If available, estimate neck and hip width for better accuracy
Use the person’s height to convert pixels to cm where necessary
🧠 2. Calculate Body Fat % Using U.S. Navy Method
For males:
Body Fat % = 86.010 * log10(waist - neck) - 70.041 * log10(height) + 36.76
For females:
Body Fat % = 163.205 * log10(waist + hip - neck) - 97.684 * log10(height) - 78.387
Notes:
All measurements should be in centimeters.
If you cannot reliably extract neck or hip from the image, use the BMI-based fallback below.
🧮 3. Fallback Formula (If Image Extraction Fails)
If the image analysis cannot return reliable waist or hip values, then:
BMI = weight (kg) / (height (m))²
Body Fat % = (1.20 × BMI) + (0.23 × age) − (10.8 × sex) − 5.4
sex = 1 for males, 0 for females
After body fat % is calculated, compute:
Lean Mass % = 100 - Body Fat %
📊 4. Fix the Visualization
Remove the debug panel and raw calculation output from the card (currently displayed as “Raw Debug Data:…”)
Retain only the donut/pie chart showing:
One red segment for Body Fat %
One green segment for Lean Mass %
Ensure both values add up to 100%
🧪 5. Test With Different User Inputs
Confirm that changing the user’s:
Height
Weight
Age
Sex
Body images
… results in visibly different Body Fat % and Lean Mass % values on the chart.
This is critical for our Body Analysis Results page. The values must be visually accurate, vary by user, and reflect their personal physique using real calculations — not defaults.
