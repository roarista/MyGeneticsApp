Hi Replit, I need your help fixing a major UI issue in my fitness app project, **MyGeneticsApp**.

### üéØ Goal:

Restore the **original MVP results page layout**, but **add some new charts** from a prototype I made in Lovable. We are NOT using the Lovable UI design anymore‚Äîjust incorporating three specific chart components into our previous layout.

---

### ‚úÖ Step-by-Step Instructions:

#### 1. **Restore the Original MVP Layout**

- Revert the current ‚Äúresults page‚Äù to the older working version that:
  - Showed body composition stats (Body Fat %, BMI, FFMI, etc.) clearly on the right.
  - Displayed the user's uploaded **Front and Back photos** on the left.
  - Included:  
    - Body Type  
    - Muscle Building Potential  
    - Circumference Measurements  
    - Top Genetic Advantages (green checkmarks)  
- Use the previous dark theme and layout as seen before the Lovable redesign.

---

#### 2. **Integrate 3 Graphs from Lovable (Add Only These New Features)**

Add the following 3 charts to the **bottom of the ‚Äúresults page‚Äù**, below the current Enhanced Bodybuilding Measurements section:

##### A. **Muscle Fiber Composition (Donut Chart)**  
- Red (Fast-Twitch Type II)  
- Blue (Slow-Twitch Type I)  
- Example: 65% Fast-Twitch / 35% Slow-Twitch

##### B. **Recovery Profile (Radar Graph)**  
- Axes: Nervous System, Muscular, Hormonal, Metabolic, Joint  
- Value range: 0 to 10  
- Example data: { Nervous: 7, Muscular: 8, Hormonal: 6, Metabolic: 5, Joint: 4 }

##### C. **Growth Potential by Muscle Group (Bar Graph)**  
- Bars for: Chest, Back, Shoulders, Arms, Legs, Core  
- Scale: 0 to 10  
- Example values: [8, 8, 6, 5, 4, 6]

---

#### 3. **How to Build the Graphs**

Use any of these libraries (whichever is easiest for you to implement with the current stack):

- `Chart.js`
- `ApexCharts`
- `Recharts`
- `Plotly.js`

**Structure:**
- Place each chart inside a styled container.
- Add chart titles and legends.
- Stack vertically if needed on mobile.

---

#### 4. **Data Notes**

- If real data isn‚Äôt generated yet, just use the example values above as static placeholder data.
- Keep the backend logic unchanged.
- Focus on visual integration, not feature reengineering.

---

### üîÅ Summary

- ‚úÖ Revert back to the working MVP UI (dark layout, left-right info split).
- ‚úÖ Keep user photo display and enhanced stats sections.
- ‚úÖ Add charts from the new design as enhancements.
- ‚ùå Don‚Äôt use the full Lovable-generated layout.
- ‚úÖ Make it look clean, readable, and MVP-ready.
