Prompt for Replit AI Agent:

Hey Replit, I need help debugging and upgrading the top-left section of the genetic analysis results page in my app MyGenetics.

🧩 Problem Summary:
The Body Composition section shows N/A for values like:
Body Fat Percentage
Body Type Classification
Muscle Building Potential
The Key Measurements section displays "No measurement data available"
However, the same data (like body fat and lean body mass) is visible on the right panel under Enhanced Bodybuilding Measurements
This tells me the left side is either not connected to the right data source or not being updated correctly after analysis
✅ Goals:
Fix the data binding:
Ensure the left panel (body composition + key measurements) pulls from the same dataset used by the right panel (like bodyMetrics, bodyAnalysis, or whatever object holds the final results).
Double-check that these components are being rendered after analysis completion.
Make sure fallback states (N/A) only show if data is truly missing—not when it's just delayed.
Unify the layout and visual style:
Match the updated UI style used in the right panel.
Add metric boxes with:
Labels (e.g. “Body Fat Percentage”)
Values (e.g. 31.9%)
Confidence indicators (green/yellow/red dots)
Consider using a reusable <MetricCard /> or similar component for consistency
Check the file structure:
Trace where the left panel components live (likely GeneticResultsPage.jsx, AnalysisLeftPanel.jsx, or similar).
Inject the correct props or state values (likely from analysisContext, useAnalysisData(), or a Redux slice depending on your app structure).
If necessary, introduce a useEffect() or lifecycle hook to listen for new data and re-render the components when data is ready.
💡 Additional Suggestions:
Once the left and right are synced, create a SharedMetricDisplay component to eliminate redundancy.
Add proper error/loading states (e.g. “Analysis failed. Please try again.” if no values returned after 5 seconds).
Next steps: Please:

Identify the missing connection to the data.
Patch the left panel to display the correct measurement values and confidence indicators.
Refactor the layout for better UX alignment with the rest of the page.
Thanks Replit! This is a big visual fix to make the app feel more complete 💪
