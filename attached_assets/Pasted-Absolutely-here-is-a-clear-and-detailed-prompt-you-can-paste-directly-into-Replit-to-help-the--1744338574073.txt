**üß† Prompt for Replit AI Agent (Internal Server Error Troubleshooting)**

---

Hi Replit, I‚Äôm getting a **500 Internal Server Error** when I click the **"Analyze my Genetics"** button on the homepage of my app. This happens after a user uploads their front and back body photos and submits their basic info (height, weight, gender, age, etc.).

### ‚úÖ CONTEXT

- The button sends data (including photos and text inputs) to a Flask route (likely `/analyze`, `/results`, or similar).
- When clicked, the app crashes and shows a **"500 Internal Server Error"**, meaning something went wrong **server-side**.
- This happened before and is usually related to image processing, input validation, or template rendering.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è WHAT I NEED YOU TO DO

1. **Trace the error:**
   - Locate the route (probably in `main.py`) that handles the form submission.
   - Wrap the logic inside that route in a `try-except` block.
   - Print the exact error to the Replit console so I can see what failed.

   Example:
   ```python
   @app.route('/analyze', methods=['POST'])
   def analyze():
       try:
           # existing logic
       except Exception as e:
           print("ERROR during analysis:", e)
           return "Internal Server Error", 500
   ```

2. **Check for likely issues:**
   - Are the uploaded images being received correctly?
   - Is any required data (height, weight, etc.) missing or empty?
   - Is there an error in the body measurement or image processing scripts?
   - Are you trying to perform a calculation like division on a zero or missing value?
   - Are you attempting to render a template with missing variables?

3. **Validate input BEFORE processing:**
   - Add code to check that all inputs exist and are valid (not `None`, empty, or corrupt).
   - If something is missing or wrong, return a helpful error message instead of crashing.

4. **Explain what went wrong:**
   - After finding the bug, explain it to me in simple terms.
   - Suggest what changes were made and how I can avoid similar issues in the future.

### üîç BONUS: Help Me Prevent This

Once it‚Äôs fixed, recommend how to:
- Validate and sanitize input on the frontend and backend.
- Show error messages to the user instead of a blank crash screen.
- Log issues automatically so I can track them more easily.
