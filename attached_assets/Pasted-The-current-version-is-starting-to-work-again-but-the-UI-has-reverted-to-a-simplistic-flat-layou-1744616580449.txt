- Fonts should be **clean sans-serif** (e.g., Inter, Roboto)
- Titles: bold and larger (20–24pt); body text smaller (14–16pt)
- Section backgrounds: slightly lighter than page background (e.g., #121212 vs #0E0E0E)
- All **graphs and progress bars** should be vivid, colorful, and match the original palette (red, yellow, green, blue, purple)
