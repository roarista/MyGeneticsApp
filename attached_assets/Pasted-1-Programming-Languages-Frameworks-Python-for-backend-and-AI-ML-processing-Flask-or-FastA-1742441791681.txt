1. Programming Languages & Frameworks
	•	Python (for backend and AI/ML processing)
	•	Flask or FastAPI (for the backend API)
	•	JavaScript (React or Vue.js) (for the frontend)
	•	HTML & CSS (for styling and UI/UX)
2. AI & Computer Vision Components
	•	OpenCV (for image and video processing)
	•	MediaPipe (for body landmark detection)
	•	TensorFlow/PyTorch (for AI model training and predictions)
	•	Pre-trained models (if available for body analysis, or train a custom model)
3. Data Handling & Storage
	•	PostgreSQL / Firebase / MongoDB (for storing user data, images, and analysis results)
	•	Cloud Storage (e.g., AWS S3, Firebase Storage) (for image and video storage)
	•	Replit Database (for lightweight storage needs, though not ideal for large datasets)
4. User Input & Interaction
	•	File Upload Feature (for images, videos, or body scans)
	•	Webcam API Integration (to capture user images/videos directly from the app)
	•	Form-Based Input (for manual data entry like height, weight, training experience)
5. Machine Learning Model Features
	•	Feature Extraction (identifying muscle insertions, bone structure, etc.)
	•	Classification & Prediction (determining genetic traits and training suggestions)
	•	Data Preprocessing (normalizing images/videos for accurate analysis)
6. Training Routine Recommendations
	•	Rule-Based System (if not using ML, simple logic for recommendations based on body traits)
	•	AI-Powered Customization (using a recommendation engine for personalized fitness plans)
7. User Authentication & Profiles
	•	OAuth (Google, Apple, etc.) (for seamless login)
	•	Email & Password Authentication (basic user account system)
	•	User Dashboard (to store and track progress)
8. Deployment & Hosting
	•	Replit Always-On Feature (to keep the backend running)
	•	Docker or Virtual Environment (to manage dependencies efficiently)
	•	Frontend Hosting on Replit or Vercel (for better UI performance)
9. Security & Privacy
	•	End-to-End Encryption (for sensitive image/video data)
	•	GDPR/Privacy Compliance (for handling user biometric data)
	•	Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) (if expanding to trainers/coaches)
10. Scalability Considerations
	•	Cloud-Based AI Processing (for heavy computations)
	•	Load Balancing & API Rate Limits (if user base grows)
	•	Optimization for Mobile Users (responsive UI, low-latency AI inference)
