Hey Replit 👋 I need your help resolving a persistent issue in my app.

### ⚠️ The Problem
After a user uploads their front/back photos and inputs height, weight, gender, and age, they click “Analyze My Genetics.” However, when redirected to the results page, the following error displays at the top:

❌ “Error displaying analysis results. Please try again.”

The enhanced measurements section still loads partially on the right side, but the **left panel stays empty**, and the overall analysis either fails or displays incomplete.

---

### 🧠 Here's What I Believe Might Be Going Wrong

Please check and fix the following:

1. **Backend Model or Processing Error**  
   - Ensure the body measurement model or analysis function isn’t returning `null`, `undefined`, or broken JSON.
   - Validate that all expected output fields (like body fat, muscle potential, insertions) are being computed and returned properly.

2. **Missing Data / Validation Issue**  
   - Some values like `body_type`, `body_fat`, `muscle_building_potential`, etc., might be `null`, which causes rendering components to fail or skip display.
   - Add checks to the frontend and backend to gracefully handle missing data (e.g., display “Not available” instead of crashing).

3. **Frontend Display Crash / Component Binding Failure**  
   - Review the logic in the result rendering component (likely a React or Jinja template).
   - Make sure all fields expected from the analysis response are checked for existence before being rendered.

4. **Error Logging and Fallbacks**  
   - Add try/catch blocks to the analysis and results-handling logic.
   - Log errors in both backend and frontend consoles.
   - Use clearer error messages, such as:  
     “We couldn’t process your photo. Please check your image quality or connection.”

### 🛠 What I Need You to Do

- [ ] ✅ Trace and debug the full analysis flow from photo upload to JSON response.
- [ ] ✅ Ensure valid data is returned and parsed correctly.
- [ ] ✅ Fix or fallback any front-end display crashes due to missing values.
- [ ] ✅ Improve error handling and replace the vague red banner with more descriptive messages.
- [ ] ✅ Test with multiple photos, heights, and weights to verify consistent success.

Let’s make this analysis process stable and user-friendly so users aren’t met with a confusing error when they’re excited to see their results. Thank you!
