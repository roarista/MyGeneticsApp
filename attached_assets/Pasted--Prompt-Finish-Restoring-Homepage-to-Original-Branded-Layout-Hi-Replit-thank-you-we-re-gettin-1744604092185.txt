🔧 Prompt: Finish Restoring Homepage to Original Branded Layout

Hi Replit — thank you, we’re getting really close. But I need help finalizing the visual design of the homepage to match how it originally looked. Here's a section-by-section breakdown of what’s still off and how to fix it:

🧬 1. HEADER (NAVBAR)
Increase padding (top and bottom) around MyGenetics ALPHA
Use a bolder font for “MyGenetics”, and a smaller, blue-colored sublabel for ALPHA
Increase left margin slightly
Keep background dark navy (#0C0C1F)
Ensure "Home" link on right stays aligned vertically
🖼 2. HERO SECTION (MAIN TITLE + SUBTEXT)
Current Issues:

Text is cramped vertically
Gradient on “GENETIC POTENTIAL” is washed out
Font is slightly small and not bold enough
Fix:

Use a larger font size (~36–40px for the main heading)
Add 40–60px vertical padding above and below
Apply a bolder, smoother gradient:
background: linear-gradient(to right, #ff416c, #ffae00);
-webkit-background-clip: text;
-webkit-text-fill-color: transparent;
font-weight: 800;
📚 3. “WHY BODY ANALYSIS MATTERS” SECTION
Fixes Needed:

Increase vertical spacing above and below this block
Add horizontal padding between the text section (left) and the form section (right)
Icons need to pop visually:
Use colored circular backgrounds with white icons inside
E.g., #2D9CDB for one, #6C5CE7 for another, #00CEC9 for third
Increase text brightness for the paragraph under each title
🧾 4. FORM CARD ("START YOUR ANALYSIS")
Adjustments:

Add padding inside the form card — ~24px on all sides
Make “Analyze My Genetics” button bright red (#FF4C4C)
Add button hover effect:
button:hover {
  background-color: #e53935;
  cursor: pointer;
}
Ensure file input labels and error messages have some vertical margin (they feel cramped)
⚙️ 5. “HOW IT WORKS” SECTION
Fixes:

Brighten icon colors:
Upload → Blue (#3498db)
AI → Indigo (#6C5CE7)
Get Results → Teal (#1ABC9C)
Focus Training → Orange (#F39C12)
Center-align text under each icon
Lighten description text (currently too dark against gray background)
Add 16–24px of padding inside each card
Add horizontal margin between cards so they don’t feel crowded
🔻 6. FOOTER
Fix:

Brighten the text color (#CCCCCC or white)
Add more vertical padding
Fix alignment of “Unlock your genetic potential” so it's visible on mobile
Ensure it doesn’t overflow or get hidden at certain resolutions
✨ GLOBAL STYLING
Use consistent font across all text (Poppins, Inter, or system sans-serif)
Buttons and inputs should use consistent border-radius (8px)
Responsive layout: make sure everything stacks properly on tablet/mobile views
✅ GOAL:
Restore everything to match how the app originally looked:

Visually strong branding
Legible, clean layout
Balanced color contrasts
Professional and premium appearance
Once this is done, I’ll move on to polishing the results page. Please show me any changes you make so I can keep versioning them.
