Prompt for Replit AI:

I'd like to improve the analysis.html page to better match my app's MVP goals. Here's a list of changes and fixes I want you to make — please implement each clearly, keeping the layout clean and visual hierarchy clear:

🎯 GOAL
Make body measurements and analysis results the centerpiece of the page, and clearly show strengths and weaknesses by muscle group using visuals and labels.

🔧 FIXES & FEATURES TO ADD
1. 🏋️ Emphasize Body Measurements

Add a "Body Measurements Summary" section directly below the photo upload.
Display key muscle group measurements (e.g., chest, arms, waist, thighs, calves).
If data is missing, show placeholders like -- cm.
2. 🔍 Add Visual Strength/Weakness Indicators

For each body part (arms, chest, shoulders, legs, back, core), add a horizontal bar with:
Red = Needs Growth
Yellow = Average
Green = Well Developed
Pull status from existing growth potential data or simulate with test values.
Example format:

Arm Development ▮▮▮▯▯   Needs Growth 🔴  
Chest Development ▮▮▮▮▮  Well Developed 🟢
3. 📸 Fix Uploaded Image Display

Ensure front and back photos display correctly in “Your Upload.”
Add alt text like: alt="Front view photo" and alt="Back view photo"
4. 📊 Reorganize Layout for Clarity

Reorder sections:
Header
AI disclaimer
Photos + Measurements
Strength/Weakness bar section
Genetic Traits & Charts
5. 💬 Remove “Confidence” Bubbles

Remove all confidence labels (medium/high confidence).
Add a single note at the top:
"These are AI-based estimates. For best accuracy, use a 3D scan when available."
6. 💡 Make It Visually Clean

Use Tailwind or simple clean CSS to:
Add soft shadows and card-style boxes for each section.
Use large, bold labels for muscle group names.
Ensure spacing between major sections.
🧪 Optional (If Data Not Available):
Add if/else logic to gracefully show placeholders or “Data not available” where appropriate.
Let me know once everything is implemented or if you hit any issues. This update is essential for ensuring the analysis page delivers meaningful value to users.
