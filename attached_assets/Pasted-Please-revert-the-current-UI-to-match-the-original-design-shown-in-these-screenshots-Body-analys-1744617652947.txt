Please revert the current UI to match the original design shown in these screenshots:

- "Personalized Nutrition plan page - upper part.png"
- "Home page upper part.png"
- "Workout Plan upper part.png"
- "Screenshot 2025-04-14 at 12.39.26 AM.png" (shows the *wrong* current version for comparison)

🧠 Design Philosophy:
- **Professional dark mode** with high contrast, fitness/tech-inspired aesthetic
- **Consistent padding and margins** across all components
- Emphasis on **data visualization** with graphs, progress bars, tags, and score badges

📊 COMPONENTS TO STYLE BACK PROPERLY

1. **Graph Cards (Muscle Dominance, Proportion Ratios, Growth Potential):**
   - White or bold title
   - High-contrast horizontal bars
   - Colored legends
   - Hover tooltips

2. **Body Metric Blocks:**
   - Rounded black/dark cards
   - Icons beside titles (e.g., fire for metabolism, dumbbell for muscle)

3. **Tags for development level:**
   - "Well Developed" = green dot + text
   - "Average" = yellow
   - "Needs Growth" = red dot

4. **Charts and Meters:**
   - Use animated progress arcs or clean radial bars
   - Radar chart (Recovery Profile) should be vivid, no pixelation
   - Sliders should be modern, with thumb indicator and label (e.g., Caloric Maintenance)

🔁 RESTORE THE OLD HTML/CSS/JS FILES

If you previously generated layout using HTML templates with external CSS:
- Please check older versions in the Replit History or reference files from:
  `Personalized workout plan upper part.png`, `Body analysis page middle part 3.png`, `Screenshot 2025-04-11 at 10.46.06 PM.png`

Make sure the new pages **reuse old layout structure** — do not replace with generic Bootstrap or flat components.

---

🎯 Goal: Match the previous design shown in all screenshots. Make it bold, visually engaging, and brand-consistent — like a futuristic fitness assistant, not a default form layout.

Do not use flat borders, standard input buttons, or plain div containers. Bring back the advanced, glowing, card-based UI from before.
